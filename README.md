# Detailed Note Taker
When user launches application (done through Heroku) the user is presented with the note taker.  The user can take notes on the main section of the screen, and click the save button when done.  The previous notes are saved to the left hand column, and can be called upon when user needs.  If user is done with note, then they can hit the delete icon, and the note will be deleted from their note history.
